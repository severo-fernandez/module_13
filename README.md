# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

Create a neural network model to asses the potential performance of start-ups if given proper funding.

# Instructions:

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

* Optimize the neural network model.

### Prepare the Data for Use on a Neural Network Model 

Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s `StandardScaler()`, preprocess the dataset so that you can use it to compile and evaluate the neural network model later.

# Import Libraries

## Imports
`import pandas as pd`

`from pathlib import Path`

`import tensorflow as tf`

`from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense`

`from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`

`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`

`from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,OneHotEncoder`

## Evaluate the model loss and accuracy metrics for all 3 models
